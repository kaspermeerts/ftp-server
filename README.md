# FTP server

An older project of mine, in which I implement the File Transfer Protocol. There are many FTP servers out there, but this one is mine.

I have fond memories of using `netcat` to try and coax FTP servers into thinking I was an FTP client, which were my first forays into the wondrous world of computer networking. At some point I wanted to really prove I understood the protocol, and so I made this server.
